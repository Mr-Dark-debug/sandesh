## 2024-03-24 - Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability
**Learning:** Hidden power-user features like `Ctrl+Enter` are often undiscovered. Explicitly visualizing them near the action button significantly improves discoverability without adding clutter if handled elegantly (e.g., small, opaque text).
**Action:** When implementing keyboard shortcuts for primary actions, always include a visual hint on the button itself or a tooltip, and ensure `aria-keyshortcuts` is set for screen readers.
